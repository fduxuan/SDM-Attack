how the catholic 's try to take advantage of the jews in every way they can , even to the point of keeping them locked away in ghettos and not allowing them to regular jobs in comparison to the passion of the christ , another recent film that people believed to be very anti semitic , merchant of venice makes passion look like a jewish holiday the film shows how the jews , or at least shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the jews received the location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film , making it just that much more realistic showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the catholics br br although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act the oh so serious trial between shylock and antonio \\( irons \\) adds a bit of humor when portia \\( collins \\) and nerissa \\( goldenhersh \\) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated that in itself might not be funny , but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing the whole cross dressing scene , as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men , which in part takes away from the scene but does n't kill it entirely br br overall the film gets a 7 out of 10", "result": "1 (100%) --> 0 (98%)",

too little to do and the plodding suspense ensures the movie finally really takes off in the way one might expect br br the direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime ! think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric \\? believe me , it is n't it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes , both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california br br there is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless br br the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wo n't reveal which movie but i 'll give 2 clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is well known and i 'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie br br the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars the actors playing the twin boys , along with the actress playing the grandmother , all try hard with the poor material they are given br br diana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers br br i paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover \\( of the region 2 version in the uk \\) comparisons were made to the exorcist , which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense , tension , tongue in cheek humour , highly disturbing content , great acting , superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically , the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s ! br br the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist , the omen , the texas chainsaw massacre , the legend of hell house , salem 's lot to name just a few being produced for this reason , the other proves an even greater disappointment br br if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting ,

and finally the end the end is so so much mediocre that i would n't expect the main character cassandra wants to give message about having baby and how a baby can change a life , in my opinion that

stock actor , david lochary , from the early john waters films while his acting is bad , he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film

by some reviewers is on me the film is 99 1 thing and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis in the 1960s and 70s , lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films , such as blood feast and monster a go go however , in recent years he 's been christened the father of gore and he has many , many fans fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts , at heart , his films are pure crap and do n't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre ! ! br br the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers when i say gruesome , it 's very bloody and nasty for 2016 though by today 's standards the special effects look amazingly lame so , while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film \\( i 'd rather not explain them they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women \\) , at least they wo n't nauseate you because they were done so poorly it 's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins but to have them doing some of the sick acts , even if unrealistic , is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny br br the only hope in the film , as the police are all idiots , is a guy named abraham gentry whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor , david lochary , from the early john waters films while his acting is bad , he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made ! ! it was also odd that so many women wanted him especially because they just did n't seem like his type br br as for the rest of the folks in the war , they are cretins and idiots who could not act in fact , i was kind of hoping more would be killed they really had it coming ! none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re shot a single scene as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed wood 's masterpiece ,

that is n't even true she says she does n't care what others think she does n't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love love , she calls it for her sex and love are one and the same br br at one point walter tells her that love is n't everything how ironic such a superfluity is to her how gratuitous the comment br br the movie is beautifully cut and masterwell directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified \\( as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within \\) he also employs a good positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another this is particularly important in the scene in which erika , like a blood drained corpse caught in stark white and black light , lies under her lover , rigid as stone here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery we do n't need to see any more br br the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes indeed she excels in them i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense what matters to her is the performance and the challenge no part is too demanding no character too depraved it 's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity , and wants us to watch her as she does she is always fascinating and nearly flawless she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work br br i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker \\( la dentelli re \\) from 1977 when she was 22 years old there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme , a parisian apprentice hairdresser her character was shy about sex and modest just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician here she is a self destructive witch , bitter with hateful knowledge of herself , shameless and entirely depraved br br huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets \\( hollywood could never make a movie like this \\) in the american cinema , only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range , but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles , here and also in la c r monie \\( 1995 \\) in which she plays a vile , spiteful murderess br br do see this for isabelle huppert you wo n't forget her or the character she brings to life", "result": "1 (100%)

the film 's power derives from the remarkable central performance \\( which can be seen as an extension of bolkan 's role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman 's skin 1971 \\) however , there 's no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro \\( who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme adopting orange red blue filters to create

judging is extraordinary acting is terrific script is awful dialog is awful action is awful music is quite good actually characteristic score for hollywood action movies this movie is so bad that it goes close to anybody andy sidaris has ever pictures it 's so bad that there is n't like used to be this poor existence to be a dvd but still , there was starring bullock and super cool \\( sarcasm

got you pumped up for this movie , please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of ` varsity blues ' or ` summer catch ' and that 's not saying much there 's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left \\? not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns , but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters ' high hopes for making in ` the big city ' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated , and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoeger 's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight , but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light , he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films , hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he 's shooting , that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here , you 'd think he 'd know better than that br br all in all , i am completely disappointed in hoeger 's first big film , and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking", "result": "0 (100%) --> 1 (58%)", "second": 58}, {"org_seq": "my son , an

for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films does n't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters instead of that , the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti war as much as the reason can offer extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting , most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces also , german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection this is the reason why stalingrad is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was this is like real , this is how the war against germans looked like this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of wwii stalingrad", "result": "1 (100%) --> 0 (100%)", "second": 2}, {"org_seq":

when other kids had playstations , i was playing zelda on my nes etc now , this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i , because of my 80 's style early childhood , watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids did n't see , and this movie was one of those , and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville , simon seville , theodore seville and david seville david , the chipmunk 's adoptive father , is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking , alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world \\( even though , technically dave is only going to europe , so to alvin , apparently only america and europe qualify as ' ' the world '' \\) david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller , much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later , at a local caf the chipmunks are playing a game of ' ' around the world in 30 days '' against the chipettes \\( brittany , jeanette and eleanore \\) after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile , alvin get 's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table , klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and , needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world , decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world , where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness \\( secretely filled with diamonds \\) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team 's likeness \\( secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds \\) to ' ' varify that they were there '' the winning team would then receive a 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal \\( an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now \\) would never suspect them because they are just kids \\( however , this seems to be redundant , because on their travels , the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls , i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally \\) and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting , not to mention the kick ass music \\( pardon my french p \\) my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ' ' the girls and boys of rock and roll '' an amazing rock song that can not be topped it 's also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include ' ' getting lucky'' \\( kind of suggestive for a kid 's film eh \\? \\) and ' ' my mother '' as well as ' ' wooly bully '' and ' ' off to see the world '' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with ' ' my mother '' still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song ' ' getting lucky '' i first did n't think anything of it , but when i grew older and learned about life , it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song , along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince 's men , when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film , it 's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway , a bit after that scene , the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband , ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon \\( as well as dave \\) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses , nancy cartwright \\( the voice of bart simpson \\) makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince , a very small , but important role the ending is of course , a happy one the crooks have been caught , the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children , dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset , alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race , which annoys dave until he finally yells ' ' alvin !

the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter dengler , the subject of the film , an obsessive compulsive or at least that 's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening closing doors and with his large stock pile of food in the cellar in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question , in a manner of speaking , to why dieter is like this well , in fact , he 's not necessarily obsessive compulsive as he is just , well , prepared and why should n't he be after the life he 's lived \\? aside from the juiciest , most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival that 's the core of the picture , the back story to dieter is fascinating too dieter 's own childhood , for example , was already a slog from the start , being in post war germnay , poor in a family without much food or prospects , eating wallpaper for the blue in the walls but enter in a passion , an un yielding desire \\( which , of course , is part of herzog 's bread butter and love of man in his films \\) , which is flying , and for dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this what it ends up leading to , after becoming an american citizen , is more than he could 've bargained for br br dieter is one of herzog 's most compelling , quirky , and compassionately observed figures in his whole career , a man who 's memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam pow , though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years ironically , the storytelling comes through unlike in the wild blue yonder mostly in lots and lots of exposition from dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps \\( the torture tactics , the bugs , the brutal , wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale \\) , and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend duane they escaped the prisons together , but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy now , through most of this , the talking does something that is enthralling , which is that as dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does re enactments \\( in fashion herzog could only do , with dieter already middle aged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle \\) , one can picture all of this in the mind it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality that herzog keeps these portions simple , and knows when to hold dieter back in his answers , makes him all the more a key figure of interest he 's not ever totally ' normal ' , but unlike a timothy treadwell , you wo nt think ever really about laughing at him either br br so , along with his hero \\( whether of war or not is hard to say , as dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes , typical but perhaps quite true \\) , herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing dieter 's early life \\( the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german rubble is always a captivating sight , and with herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music \\) , and in capturing the footage of vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings , there 's no ' i was used by the americans ' or whatever thrown into the mix there 's even a sense that dieter does n't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him , that it 's just what happens in time of war \\( and , of course , he was dropping bombs on people from his plane \\) now , through much of these harrowing and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons , bathrooms and the scraps of food it 's always harrowing luckily herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well one of my very favorite scenes in the film , where herzog breaks away for a moment from dieter , is when he shows a ' trainee ' film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife , a flare gun , and a very fast helicopter to come around \\( and this is put to hilariously dead pan voice over work \\) br br yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis , and how one ca n't ever really imagine what it 's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war time dieter , aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have \\( and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber , elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes \\) , knows what it is to have to survive at all costs but yet , as well , as in many of herzog 's protagonist driven films , there 's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one 's strong enough , even through horrid moments \\( the fate of dunae \\) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter \\( is he american , or a spy , they ask on the chopper \\) dieter is such a man with a spirit , and he 's given via herzog a fantastic , tragic , creative , well shot

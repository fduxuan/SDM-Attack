some time for our drinks he messed up a dinner order and said that cook must have read the order wrong , so while 3 of us received our dinners , 1 sat with an empty bread plate we had to ask for bread and he appeared very upset by that , commenting , i was about to bring it to you anyway nwe waited quite some time for the checks when he finally appeared , he said that the person that rang up our order , did it incorrectly , so he made the corrections in pen on the receipt we closely looked at the check and saw errors right away when we brought it to his attention , he made another smart comment about another server probably ringing it up wrong nnever a winked , thank you , have a good night , nothing it was an incredibly negative experience a member of our party spoke to a manger as we were leaving when he told the manager some of the comments made by our server , she said i know exactly who you are talking about was it \\? and it was whoa i do n't care so much that the service was a littlest slow , it was the server 's negative attitude that totally turned me off again , our food was great , but i just ca n't justify paying 50 bucks for dinner drinks and being treated so

southwest , these days n nyou know that 's the case when the server comes over to offer you any one of what he claims are the 250 tequilas they have behind the bar \\( ! \\? \\) he describes a margarita special they 're offering made with some brand i 've never heard of , agave juice and freshly squeezed lime sounds unbelieveable , but turns out to be a tad too subtle for me , and those agave sugars are a bit slippery on my tongue so , while i politely acknowledge that the first one was good , i tell him , in response to his question , that i like my margaritas with don julio and cointreau and ask for my next one that way n nfirst downer , he gets a little snooty about what a rube i am n nhey mr cool i 'm your customer if i like my margarita with ketchup , your job is to give me an excited smile and ask , one squeeze pack or two \\? n npassing by the margarita moment , we start out with table made guacamole it 's gets 3 stars for not having enough lime , salt or garlic , but still being pretty good they add pomegranate seeds for that bistro flair , but while it comes off as interesting , it 's not as good as your well made traditional guac n nthey serve their sit down table salsa with another somewhat contrived bistro element bread and not chips roasted peppers , however , made it pretty tasty , so i 'm not complaining n non to dinner , and actually , that 's what gets them up to 4 stars their chile en nogada , i think they call it , was a large poblano chile stuffed with chicken , apricots , peaches \\( \\? and another ! \\) , garlic and almonds in a light

still were n't happy with the size of this steak i do n't know , maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something also , this is the worst dry aged steak i 've eaten it did n't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging additionally , it was n't adequately seasoned this was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this we ate the steak because we were hungry \\( and paid an arm and a leg for it \\) , but we were n't happy n nwe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig now we 're talking ! this thing was as advertised juicy , flavorful , with that great crispy skin we got as much meat off of the thing as we could , but all of us could have used more n nfor sides , we went with the delmonico potatoes , asparagus , and carrots all were good , the potatoes were almost too decadent \\( if such a state exists \\) the asparagus is small , but it was cooked well i could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce the carrots with pepper and greek yogurt was probably the table favorite i 'd absolutely get this dish again n nwe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal they , like the rest of the meal , were hit and miss n noverall , i 'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in las vegas i do n't know if we went on a bad night \\( as noted above , i 've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did , november 15 , 2014 , that complained about the service \\) i also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues but , for what we paid , a lot of the things

experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham handed piercing technique after having both nipples pierced , a labret , an industrial , nose ring , tongue , and ears spaced , and a multitude of other piercings , i am aware of what to expect when i decide to do further body modification n nthe staff that was working was , simply put , rude they were consider disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous since i was there for a tragus and not to make guys i tried to dismiss this effrontery while the mood temporarily lightened once i went back for the piercing , the young lady with dreadlocks could n't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and slightly ostentatious again , i soldiered on as i was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff if the verbal treatment of the staff was n't necessary to turn me off to sadu permanently the piercer 's brutish handling missed any semblance of finesse so i shall give her skills five stars five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the cosmic n nif you can not afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you i would thoroughly recommend sadu , if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience i would go elsewhere n np s to be completely fair they have great jewelry , but nothing you ca n't find online for the same price good

with a paper towel , but really it 's all it needs to get it clean compared to the usual grills that need to be replaced and deeply scrubbed i like this kind of grill and the ventilation is decent

can be wrong with his food unless i have something personal against him i do n't think i need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who i personally do n't like he also

the spicy they had was sweet , which i did n't like at all the arroz con mariscos was bland , hardly any flavor the pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal , being dry and unflavorful we did get a free soup with our meal , which was the best thing we tasted there the sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them , and were not refilled until i finally had to ask we also had to ask for the

our server if i could finish my can of beer at the table sure , katy said flashing a smile yeah , i 'm cheap and i hate spending money on expensive steaks and drinks i was set to order one of the cheapest things on the menu \\( kobe burger at 20 \\) , when i mentioned to her that i 've been disappointed every time i ordered a 30 steak she replied that their rib cap was the best steak she 's ever had she tried to explain what a rib cap was , but her friendliness was so disarming that i ordered it if fully understanding where on the cow the meat was coming from i normally like medium , but i know medium rare should be the way to go she suggested something in between medium rare plus i doubted her cooks ' skills but she assured me that their heating control was outstanding n nwhat 's a rib cap \\? i had to look it up when i got home on a chunk of roast there 's the familiar rib eye loin and then that layer of fat along the top when you cut away the eye , there 's quite a bit of meat still attach to the fat that 's the rib cap n nout came the meat , and i immediately cut into it it was n't running blood , but it was still full of that that happy pink center you expect from a gently cooked steak \\( medium rare plus ! \\) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib cap the robust flavor of the rib eye , the tenderness of a filet , and the mouth melting fat of pork belly a trifecta worth the 60 the sides were awesome , but i could n't interrupted sympathy each bite of my steak n nkaty checked in , and i was dramatic that the product delivered she noticed my can of pale ale was out , and suggested i tried an ipa wine just would n't do with this steak , and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl i mentioned to the server extraordinaire , that the only problem i had with the rib cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth , the excitement of the next bite was slightly receding n nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo , palate cleanser so my last bite was just like my first", "result": "1

couple in the restaurant and they appeared to be done with their meal i e no plates or silverware , enjoying coffee we continued to wait n nafter about 10 minutes i stood up to clarify our order with the guy behind the register we ordered chili to go , right \\? the guy called out to inquire about the status of the chili and the chef burst out of the kitchen saying , yes , you ordered it to go , right \\? right \\? i 'm preparing it to go right \\? that 's what i understood to go ! ! n nthe whole experience was just kind of bizarre and dramatic and borderline rude n nnot to mention that while we we waiting a group of four came in they got the same frantic explanation about the limited menu they chose to sit down they made the mistake of bringing in outside drinks \\( iced coffees \\) now , while i was waiting i spied the signs about outside drinks not being allowed i then watched the chef approach the table and just take the drinks from the customer and put them in the garbage no verbal explanations no , hey , would you like to finish that \\? we do n't allow outside drinks she just took them from the customers and threw them away really \\? \\? the customers were glad of playing along with the drama , but you could tell that that action was a direct hit n indeed the two 16 oz containers of chili come out yay ! then he rings me up 10 per serving \\? \\? i 'm sorry , that seems high to me 21 62 for two medium sized containers to go \\? \\? whatever , just give me my food n nand now onto the food ! the one thing i ordered it was a pumpkin , squash , black bean chili it was excellent ! the mixture was seasoned really well , the flavors and textures were well combined it was some of the best vegan chili i 've ever had ! n ni really wanted to have a great experience the cool , divey exterior , the photos of adopted turkeys on the walls , the fact it was a fully vegan shop but i did n't and honestly , i do n't think i would go back n nfootnote as we were leaving and

man answered i asked if they had booths he said no , but he would give us their best table , table 15 he said it was in a quiet corner by itself i thanked him for that said it was for our anniversary , so that must be great nwe found the place , in a strip mall there was a laundromat a few door down ! we thought this place was going to be nice parking was terrible as 1 would let on ellsworth as we walked up to the place , we saw through the window that table 15 was already filled uh oh ! it was fairly empty 3 tables 6 at the bar i tried to say we had resevations when the waitress came up yes , yes , yes she said then asked us something about the menus unfortunately , i did n't understand her through her french accent i said give us both menus tom realized she had said regular or groupon menu , we got the regular menu she sat us at a table right at the end of the bar kitchen , not at all private nwe placed our order , waited for long periods of time for each course i know , made to order takes a while , there was just the 1 cook , but we did wait , a lot , they were n't that busy ! tom got the escargot , salade lyonnaise the bouillabaisse i ordered the vol au vent with shrimp scallops , salade d ' endive et de betteraves the roti de canard au cassis we also got a bottle of wine from the very few selection we finished with the profiteroles for dessert the food was good but , it was n't outstanding , just good my duck was actually overcooked , burnt on the bottom every plate was covered to the rim with parsley the waitress seemed hurried , not to be bothered her response was always monsieur madam , yes , yes , merci , merci , then she was gone for what we paid , with tip , about 200 , we were sorely disappointed for 200 , there are alot of other restaurants we could 've gone to been extremely happy with our evening ntom went to the bathroom said it was n't very clean as well , he said doors were open to the dishwashing room somewhere else he said the sights in those rooms were not something you 'd want to see nat 1 point , 5 older men who were at the bar drinking , sat down at the table next to us really \\? \\? \\? 7 8 other tables they sit next to us \\? \\? \\? \\? they had been drinking quite a bit at the bar when they sat down , each of them had their own bottle of wine to have with their meal , as if they needed more alcohol ! they were loud , they were obnoxious , they were rude they said they were dentists 1 more reason why i fear doctors ! they made racial comments they made sexual comments the waitress did n't help she would come over basically let these guys paw her up 1 guy grabbed her leg as she went by another said he wanted he wanted her breasts , not the check she went along with all of it in fact , suddenly , her thick french accent was gone ! nwe wo n't be back there again !", "result": "0 (100%) --> 1 (72%)", "second": 38}, {"org_seq": "got the create your own tacos for 7 25 , soft flour , carne asada , asadero

bottom line is that it 's not worth going to a spot when the odds are the service and food will totally disappoint n had had two people visiting from out of places , and forgot dish was closed , so we discussed hey , the diamond was n't too bad last time , let 's keep there luckily , there was no wait , the four of we sat down , asked what the specials were and it gave out they were out of the specials two of us then found the black bean burger they were out of that too we got some other things , and a starter of fried pickles , which were okay my mate answered the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh , because she was worried about a blt the waiter seemed offended and murmured a rude , yes then we waited and waited for the food it knew way too long to come out n nwe finally got our dishes i was okay with mine , but everyone else was very surprised it was as if diamond shops for the nice bottom rung ingredients if you put a salad on a menu , it should be at least somewhat messy the small block burger was a sad , ugly thing the tomatoes were hard and without much flavor one person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as disgusting i was embarrassed to have brought friends there n nthe take away lesson here is that it 's great to be a local institution it 's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele but if you 're a restaurant , it 's still all about the food for most of your patrons you need to have quality food and do n't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner especially when you 're charging 9 or more for some plates a lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price n nso the diamond is still a great place to get a drink , but they 've got to overhaul nearly everything

was what i would expect from an olive garden caliber place the ligunie is where i took offense the basic concepts of cooking this dish were today this is my favoite dish and something i considered a sort of a good italian restaurant the pasta was overcooked to a mushy state the seafood was generous however was also cooked all of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl i ate the entire meal with fear i would have this red water in my lap or all over the table ni am confused by the numerous high ratings for la calabria i have grown up eating great italian and recently moved to phoenix if my only experience of italian food was eating chuck e cheese i might be more inclined to give 3 stars if you are looking for a great italian meal

manager did i think michael maybe refilled our drinks \\? the first manager looking guy dropped off our apps here 's the skinny on what we had nbeer battered bacon this is worth a star it was greasy but oddly delicious nbrussels sprouts flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle nbacon egg and cheese deviled eggs nothing to write home about they were small and pretty smoky tasting n for entrees , i ordered the fried egg blt and my sister ordered the bison burger my blt was fine again , nothing to write home about there was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering and the egg could have been runnier but another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious nmy sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done like we think this bison is dead but let 's burn it at the stake just to make sure it 's really really dead she decided to send it back and so we waited and waited and a brand new server \\( still not michael \\) came by to check on us she went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star , but i was so put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up umm why would n't the manager come over herself to apologize \\? or at least to check on us after the replacement came \\? and also , it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that nall in all , destihl has good bacon , inattentive staff , poor leadership , and too much desire to be cool and where is michael \\? my receipt says he was my server but i do n't even know if i saw him , and i fear my tip went to someone who did n't do any work ! i wo n't be back", "adv_seq": "i 'm so bad ni'm in champaign visiting my sister , and a friend of ours recommended we go to destihl he touted it as a gift from the gods like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning after looking at the menu , how could i resist \\? \\? nso we went today for a full lunch \\( around 2 30 \\) and found the places damn much deserted there were some people working in the bar who retained eye contact with us but did n't

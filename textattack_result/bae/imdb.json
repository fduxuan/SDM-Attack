speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away , the film 's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s the brotherhood

well set up , lit , and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two for example , i 've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem

while , you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations given the imdb rating of 4 0 , i was n't really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil 's rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films i could n't ' have been more wrong what i got instead was an ambitious and sophisticated movie with a cast i really enjoyed speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away , the film 's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so deep in the early 70s the brotherhood of satan does n't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks as a viewer , you know something is amiss , but for the longest period you 're just not sure what it is the unknown may make for a even creepier atmosphere than most similar films the ending is terrible with its surreal imagery i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll those wanting a big slam bang finale will be disappointed with the ending 's simplicity a lesser film would have needed to pull out all the stops and would , most likely , have failed miserably br br there are moments in the film where it 's easy to forget the director , bernard mceveety , had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan there are a few scenes that are so well set up , lit , and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two for example , i 've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors not here the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff 's office is amazing we

this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was br br this film had no middle to it it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched ' i did n't get it at all , ' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again , but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending i feel every single person had been way down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was br br lets put the bad points to one side i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end it was unexpected , it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position the lighting and the effects made it look excellent , this scene looked slightly more 1990 's than the 1970 's that this film is supposed to be br br this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it did again , it totally went against an audiences expectations , even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger , not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well , but this one did n't , it was a creative , different unusual film i thought , it had potential could of been better , disappointed did just enjoy it , would n't buy it on dvd

insulting this wreck of a movie but i do n't think i will long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller \\( i use that term loosely \\) that fails to have the hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending , bland deaths , acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood , and a decent soundtrack br br i'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual it was a low budget movie , they did the best they could with such a low budget , and all that other nonsense but when you get right down to it there was very little that they could 've really spent that budget on , there was very little special effects work , the soundtrack sounds like it might 've been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned , and it 's the same damn crew from those two films this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good , and it was called mr jingles , the two are about the same quality , they fail to deliver anything

my favorite actors , robert montgomery his films are mostly rarely watched these days , except for those that were regular for most of his career meaning that the roles that frequently look on television are they were expendable , the lady in the lake , june bride , night must fall , the saxon charm , ride the pink horse , rage in heaven , the earl of chicago \\( in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in \\) it 's ironic that nowadays when one reminds of montgomery 's career it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 that are pushed the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b mayer knew the pity of this is that montgomery was a gifted comedian , and saved many films from being routine br br petticoat fever is one such film made in 1936 with picadilly jim and trouble for two it was a banner series of good performances by montgomery , and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play danny in night must fall the next year br br petticoat fever is set in labrador , and montgomery is a weather station operator there named dascom dinsmore he has been living there for five years , and has not been in the company of a woman \\( except for inuit women \\) for most of that time he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara \\( winifred shotter \\) who he sort of proposed to , but it 's been two years since he has heard from her , so that he believes she has given up on him br br dinsmore 's world is rocked when sir james felton and irene campton \\( reginald owen and myrna loy \\) show up they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that felton was to address felton is engaged to campton , but dinsmore finds her around and gradually she finds him equally attractive certainly the silly , self important , and hopelessly inept felton is no competition \\( it is a measure of owen 's acting that he keep the character entertaining however if one finds it hard to believe such a boob is a canadian captain of industry \\) br br there is something bizarre about this film probably due to the original play while the labrador scenery is quite phony looking it does serve it 's purpose for the comedy \\( witness th polar bear sequence \\) but the height of the surrealism is the dinner dinsmore serves his guests , a dinner of pemmican steaks , which owen eats with real gusto owen \\( a minor noble as a baronet \\) is dressed in normal clothing a winter suit for the climate \\) but montgomery is dressed in his suit of evening dress \\( as though attending a ball at the embassy \\) loy , seeing him dress up , likewise puts on a gown they are being served by dinsmore 's servant assistant , the inuit kimo \\( otto yamaoka \\) , who is wearing a suit of evening dress too it turns out that it is owen 's ! owen , who earlier insisted that dinsmore change into clothing more suitable to his station ,

from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria \\( which is baffling in the first place \\) and make it to the big city suddenly realizing he 's been used and that his love was a sham , matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before ` the big game ' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time , but he 's too hot headed to buy it so what will matt do \\? will he take her back \\? or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all round jerk \\? i wo n't ruin the super ultra surprising ending for you br br end spoiler br br so , if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie , please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of ` varsity blues ' or ` summer catch ' and that 's not saying much there 's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left \\? not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns , but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters ' high hopes for making in ` the big city ' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated , and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoeger 's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight , but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light , he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films , hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he 's shooting , that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here , you 'd think he 'd know better than that br br all in all , i am completely disappointed in hoeger 's first big film , and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking", "result": "0 (100%) --> 1 (53%)", "second": 205}, {"org_seq": "my son , an avid skateboarder , sat me

set in paris , does not have that edge at all and simply is n't in the same class but it does have some good ies going for it that the first film did not have and overall it 's still fun to watch br br so , werewolf purists aside , most of whom note this film is pure garbage compared to the london version , i 'll still give it decent marks since i do n't care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that part , too br br the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character , played by julie delpy i do n't see enough of this actress she does n't seem to make that many films , or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty , so the film got points for having her in it , and she looks great br br when the horror starts , it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film , unlike the first one no f words and no lord 's name in vain amazing ! br br however , there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which is n't appealing to a middle aged guy like me , either this film is geared a lot more toward 20 somethings , if that helps anyone br br it 's entertaining just do n't expect it to live up to the first film", "result": "1 (100%) --> 0 (56%)", "second": 6}, {"org_seq": "oh boy ! i really trashed

playstations , i was playing zelda on my nes etc now , this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i , because of my 80 's style early childhood , watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids did n't see , and this movie was one of those , and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville , simon seville , theodore seville and david seville david , the chipmunk 's adoptive father , is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking , alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world \\( even though , technically dave is only going to europe , so to alvin , apparently only america and europe qualify as ' ' the world '' \\) david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller , much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later , at a local caf the chipmunks are playing a game of ' ' around the world in 30 days '' against the chipettes \\( brittany , jeanette and eleanore \\) after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile , alvin get 's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table , klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and , needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world , decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world , where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness \\( secretely filled with diamonds \\) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team 's likeness \\( secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds \\) to ' ' varify that they were there '' the winning team would then receive a 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal \\( an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now \\) would never suspect them because they are just kids \\( however , this seems to be redundant , because on their travels , the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls , i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally \\) and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting , not to mention the kick ass music \\( pardon my french p \\) my favorite song is without a shred of doubt ' ' the girls and boys of rock and roll '' an amazing rock song that can not be topped it 's also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include ' ' getting lucky'' \\( kind of suggestive for a kid 's film eh \\? \\) and ' ' my mother '' as well as ' ' wooly bully '' and ' ' off to see the world '' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with ' ' my mother '' still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song ' ' getting lucky '' i first did n't think anything of it , but when i grew older and learned about life , it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song , along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince 's men , when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film , it 's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway , a bit after that scene , the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband , ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon \\( as well as dave \\) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses , nancy cartwright \\( the voice of bart simpson \\) makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince , a very small , but important role the ending is of course , a happy one the crooks have been caught , the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children , dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset , alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race , which annoys dave until he finally yells ' ' alvin !
